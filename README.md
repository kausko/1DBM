# One Database Manager (1DBM)
One Database Manager is a key-store for database credentials, and a common platform for querying databases, rolled into one. With 1DBM, you can:

 - Store all of your database credentials in one place, and access them using a single password (or an API key), just like a password manager.
 - Query any of these databases using REST APIs.

 - Convenient and safe storage for database credentials.
 - No need for any drivers to make queries to your database.
 - Possible to make queries to your database from your client.
